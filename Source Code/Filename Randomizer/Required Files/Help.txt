Filename Randomizer renames all the files within a specified folder, generated a random name for each file. The randomizer makes use of random number concatenation, plus a time stamp, all of which is then hashed using MD5 to leave us with the final random file name. Note that the folder parsing is not recursive in nature.

The files are all backed up before the process is undertaken.

To start the operation, simply click on the Begin button. 

The help and about menu options brings up the help and about dialog boxes respectively.
